Controllers:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/
In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state.
Kubernetes comes with a set of built-in controllers that run inside the kube-controller-manager. These built-in controllers provide important core behaviors.
The Deployment controller and Job controller are examples of controllers that come as part of Kubernetes itself ("built-in" controllers).

ReplicaSet:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/
A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. Usually, you define a Deployment and let that Deployment manage ReplicaSets automatically.
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. However, a Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features.
