The ideal way to setup spring boot application is to create a maven project and add the spring boot dependency into it. For example when we create the spring mvc using spring boot, we add the spring-boot-starter-web dependency. When maven encounters this dependency, it downloads all the jars related to that dependency and adds them to classpath. In this case maven downloads all the jars related to spring mvc (like spring-web and spring-web-mvc etc.) and add them to classpath.

When SpringApplication.run() runs, it scans the classpath and according to the jars present in the classpath, it takes necessary configuration steps. For example in this case, when springboot encounters the spring mvc jars in the classpath, it intializes a DsiaptcherServlet and takes other steps necessary for bootstrapping spring mvc project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starter POMs and Auto-Configuration

Auto-configuration is designed to work well with “Starter POMs”, but the two concepts are not directly tied. You are free to pick-and-choose jar dependencies outside of the starter POMs and Spring Boot will still do its best to auto-configure your application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all the following:

1. @SpringBootConfiguration enable registration of extra beans in the context or the import of additional configuration classes. An alternative to Spring’s standard @Configuration that aids configuration detection in your integration tests.

2. @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

3. Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

4. @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package (in the package that where the main() class resides and its sub-packges), allowing it to find the controllers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Boot:

"Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run"."

1. Opinionated 
(it gives an opinion about a project, as in what should be the starting point of your project or what should be the intial structure of the project and creates that project and configurations for you. Having the default project with you, you are then free to make custom configrations in it.)

2. Convention over Configuration
(It configures a project using the default configuration assuming that the developer may want to use the default configs, ie it uses standard convention to setup a project and do the majority of the default work for the developer. If the developer wants to do some custom config, he is welcome to do so.)
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27478/convention-over-configuration
https://facilethings.com/blog/en/convention-over-configuration

3. Stand alone 
(It does not need a servlet container. It embeds a container of its own and while bootstraping the application using spring application context, it intializes the container and starts it. Hence it is stand alone.)

4. Production ready 
(ie, we do not have to configure anything extra,just package the application as jar and run it in production. No extra config needed.)

5. AutoConfiguration:
It auto configures many aspects of the application(using @EnableAutoConfiguration). Like if you have some embedded database in your classpath, then it auto configures a dataSource for you. You can always override the default configs using "exclude" attribute of @EnableAutoConfiguration.

@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyConfiguration {
}

you can also control the list of auto-configuration classes to exclude by using the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property.

Starting Spring Boot:

What does the class SpringApplication.run(); does behind the scenes:

1. Sets up default configuration (convention over configuration)
2. Starts Spring Application Context (Starts the Application context, ie the Spring container which handles all the beans)
3. Performs class path scan (It scans the class path for all the classes that are annotated with @Controller, @Service and so on)
4. Starts Tomcat Server

10.3.3 The main method

The final part of our application is the main method. This is just a standard method that follows the Java convention for an application entry point. Our main method delegates to Spring Boot's SpringApplication class by calling run. SpringApplication will bootstrap our application, starting Spring which will in turn start the auto-configured Tomcat web server. We need to pass Example.class as an argument to the run method to tell SpringApplication which is the primary Spring component. The args array is also passed through to expose any command-line arguments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A snippet of log when spring boot starts:
2018-10-02 12:51:37.583  INFO 7204 --- [ost-startStop-1] o.s.b.w.servlet.ServletRegistrationBean  : Servlet dispatcherServlet mapped to [/]

Note that spring boot automatically registers and maps the DispatcherServlet to the url-mapping "/"(An example of auto configuration, when spring boot sees spring mvc jars in the classpath).

Check the logs once when boot starts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check how spring boot does the component scan. Whether we need to put the @Controller annotated classes on the same package hierarchy as the main() class or not.- Checked, the annotated classes has to be in the same package hierarchy as the main() class. This is the default configuration that spring boot configures(convention over configuration).

SEE also: https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

@SpringBootApplication implicitly adds the @ComponentScan anntation and it scans all the classes in the package(and sub-packages) where the main() class resides.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring Boot: Bills of Materials

Generally when we configure a Spring MVC using Spring Boot, we give the dependencies in the pom.xml like:

	<parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.5.RELEASE</version>
    </parent>
    
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Instead of giving all the dependencies that is required to build the Spring MVC project without Spring Boot, we provide only:

	<dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
	
This tells maven which jars to download, and this:

	<parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.5.RELEASE</version>
    </parent>


tells maven what versions of those jars to download. The version of the parent(spring-boot-starter-parent) determines, what versions of the jars to download. These versions of the jars are compatible with each other and is known as "Bills of Materials". These preset version of jars are determined by the spring as to be compatible versions.

Embedded Tomcat Server Advantages:

1. Convenience
2. Servlet Container config is now application config (ie Server related config can now be done in code itself)
3. Standalone Application
4. Useful for MicroService Architecture (In microservice architecture, deploying multiple modules in servers multiple times can be cumbersome. Whereas using Spring Boot, deploying a application is as simple as running a command and the application is up and running.)

If we want other server than tomcat, we need to mention that in the pom.xml.

We generally recommend that you locate your main application class in a root package above other classes. The @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation is often placed on your main class, and it implicitly defines a base â€œsearch packageâ€� for certain items. For example, if you are writing a JPA application, the package of the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotated class will be used to search for @Entity items.

Using a root package also allows the @ComponentScan annotation to be used without needing to specify a basePackage attribute.

10.5 Creating an executable jar:

Letâ€™s finish our example by creating a completely self-contained executable jar file that we could run in production. Executable jars (sometimes called â€œfat jarsâ€�) are archives containing your compiled classes along with all of the jar dependencies that your code needs to run.

To create an executable jar we need to add the spring-boot-maven-plugin to our pom.xml. Insert the following lines just below the dependencies section:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

Save your pom.xml and run "mvn package" (or "mvn clean install") from the command line.

If you look in the target directory you should see myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar. The file should be around 10 Mb in size.

You should also see a much smaller file named myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original in the target directory. This is the original jar file that Maven created before it was repackaged by Spring Boot.

To run that application, use the java -jar command.

Note: Executable jars and Java

Java does not provide any standard way to load nested jar files (i.e. jar files that are themselves contained within a jar). This can be problematic if you are looking to distribute a self-contained application.

To solve this problem, many developers use â€œshadedâ€� jars. A shaded jar simply packages all classes, from all jars, into a single â€œuber jarâ€�. The problem with shaded jars is that it becomes hard to see which libraries you are actually using in your application. It can also be problematic if the the same filename is used (but with different content) in multiple jars.

Spring Boot takes a different approach and allows you to actually nest jars directly.

From: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application

12.1.4 Using the Spring Boot Maven plugin
Spring Boot includes a Maven plugin that can package the project as an executable jar. Add the plugin to your <plugins> section if you want to use it:

<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>

10.4 Running the example

Since we have used the spring-boot-starter-parent POM we have a useful run goal that we can use to start the application. Type "mvn spring-boot:run" from the root project directory to start the application. (If we use this command, no jar is created in the target folder)

14.1 Importing additional configuration classes
You don't need to put all your @Configuration into a single class. The @Import annotation can be used to import additional configuration classes. Alternatively, you can use @ComponentScan to automatically pickup all Spring components, including @Configuration classes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application
15.1 Gradually replacing auto-configuration
Auto-configuration is noninvasive, at any point you can start to define your own configuration to replace specific parts of the auto-configuration. For example, if you add your own DataSource bean, the default embedded database support will back away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/using/devtools.html
Applications that use spring-boot-devtools automatically restart whenever files on the classpath change. This can be a useful feature when working in an IDE, as it gives a very fast feedback loop for code changes.
If you do not want to use the restart feature, you can disable it by using the spring.devtools.restart.enabled property.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/spring-application.html
SpringApplication allows an application to be initialized lazily. When lazy initialization is enabled, beans are created as they are needed rather than during application startup.
A downside of lazy initialization is that it can delay the discovery of a problem with the application.
It can be enabled using the spring.main.lazy-initialization property as shown in the following example:
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true
If you want to disable lazy initialization for certain beans while using lazy initialization for the rest of the application, you can explicitly set their lazy attribute to false using the @Lazy(false) annotation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/spring-application.html#features.spring-application.command-line-runner
If you need to run some specific code once the SpringApplication has started, you can implement the ApplicationRunner or CommandLineRunner interfaces. Both interfaces work in the same way and offer a single run method, which is called just before SpringApplication.run(…) completes.
This contract is well suited for tasks that should run after application startup but before it starts accepting traffic.

@Component
public class MyCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

	@Override
	public void run(String... args) {
		// Do something...
	}

}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/spring-application.html#features.spring-application.application-exit
Each SpringApplication registers a shutdown hook with the JVM to ensure that the ApplicationContext closes gracefully on exit. All the standard Spring lifecycle callbacks (such as the DisposableBean interface or the @PreDestroy annotation) can be used.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html

It is recommended to stick with one format for your entire application. If you have configuration files with both .properties and YAML format in the same location, .properties takes precedence.

Environment variables and system properties often have restrictions that mean some property names cannot be used. To help with this, Spring Boot allows you to encode a block of properties into a single JSON structure.
When your application starts, any spring.application.json or SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON properties will be parsed and added to the Environment.

spring.config.name, spring.config.location, and spring.config.additional-location are used very early to determine which files have to be loaded. They must be defined as an environment property (typically an OS environment variable, a system property, or a command-line argument).
If you prefer to add additional locations, rather than replacing them, you can use spring.config.additional-location. Properties loaded from additional locations can override those in the default locations.

If several profiles are specified, a last-wins strategy applies. For example, if profiles prod,live are specified by the spring.profiles.active property, values in application-prod.properties can be overridden by those in application-live.properties.

if no profiles are explicitly activated, then properties from application-default are considered.

Multi-document property files are often used in conjunction with activation properties such as spring.config.activate.on-profile

To use configuration property scanning, add the @ConfigurationPropertiesScan annotation to your application. Typically, it is added to the main application class that is annotated with @SpringBootApplication but it can be added to any @Configuration class. By default, scanning will occur from the package of the class that declares the annotation.

As well as using @ConfigurationProperties to annotate a class, you can also use it on public @Bean methods. Doing so can be particularly useful when you want to bind properties to third-party components that are outside of your control.

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.enabling-annotated-types

Spring Boot attempts to validate @ConfigurationProperties classes whenever they are annotated with Spring’s @Validated annotation.
To ensure that validation is always triggered for nested properties, the associated field must be annotated with @Valid.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/logging.html

If you want to write log files in addition to the console output, you need to set a logging.file.name or logging.file.path property (for example, in your application.properties). If both properties are set, logging.file.path is ignored and only logging.file.name is used.
Log files rotate when they reach 10 MB and, as with console output, ERROR-level, WARN-level, and INFO-level messages are logged by default.

If you are using the Logback, it is possible to fine-tune log rotation settings using your application.properties or application.yaml file. For all other logging system, you will need to configure rotation settings directly yourself (for example, if you use Log4j2 then you could add a log4j2.xml or log4j2-spring.xml file).

All the supported logging systems can have the logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) by using logging.level.<logger-name>=<level> where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.
Example:
logging.level.root=warn
logging.level.org.springframework.web=debug
logging.level.org.hibernate=error

You can force Spring Boot to use a particular logging system by using the org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingSystem system property.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/task-execution-and-scheduling.html
In the absence of an Executor bean in the context, Spring Boot auto-configures an AsyncTaskExecutor. When virtual threads are enabled (using Java 21+ and spring.threads.virtual.enabled set to true) this will be a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor that uses virtual threads. Otherwise, it will be a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with sensible defaults. In either case, the auto-configured executor will be automatically used for:
1. asynchronous task execution (@EnableAsync)
2. Spring for GraphQL’s asynchronous handling of Callable return values from controller methods
3. Spring MVC’s asynchronous request processing
4. Spring WebFlux’s blocking execution support
Note: Both SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor and ThreadPoolTaskExecutor are AsyncTaskExecutor.

When a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is auto-configured, the thread pool uses 8 core threads that can grow and shrink according to the load. Those default settings can be fine-tuned using the spring.task.execution namespace, as shown in the following example:
spring.task.execution.pool.max-size=16
spring.task.execution.pool.queue-capacity=100
spring.task.execution.pool.keep-alive=10s
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/developing-auto-configuration.html#features.developing-auto-configuration.locating-auto-configuration-candidates
https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-custom-auto-configuration

Classes that implement auto-configuration are annotated with @AutoConfiguration. This annotation itself is meta-annotated with @Configuration, making auto-configurations standard @Configuration classes.

Spring Boot checks for the presence of a META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports file within your published jar. The file should list your configuration classes.

We could add the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation with exclude or excludeName attribute to a configuration class to disable a particular autoconfiguration.
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration(
  exclude={MySQLAutoconfiguration.class})
public class AutoconfigurationApplication {
    //...
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/servlet.html

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Spring MVC that works well with most applications. It replaces the need for @EnableWebMvc and the two(ie @SpringBootApplication and @EnableWebMvc) cannot be used together.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties
If you don't like application.properties as the configuration file name you can switch to another by specifying a spring.config.name environment property. You can also refer to an explicit location using the spring.config.location environment property (comma-separated list of directory locations, or file paths).

$ java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.name=myproject
or
$ java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.location=classpath:/default.properties,classpath:/override.properties

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties

22. Profiles
Spring Profiles provide a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it only available in certain environments. Any @Component or @Configuration can be marked with @Profile to limit when it is loaded:

@Configuration
@Profile("production")
public class ProductionConfiguration {

    // ...

}
In the normal Spring way, you can use a spring.profiles.active Environment property to specify which profiles are active. You can specify the property in any of the usual ways, for example you could include it in your application.properties:

spring.profiles.active=dev,hsqldb
or specify on the command line using the switch --spring.profiles.active=dev,hsqldb.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties

21.3 Profile specific properties
In addition to application.properties files, profile specific properties can also be defined using the naming convention application-{profile}.properties.

Profile specific properties are loaded from the same locations as standard application.properties, with profiles specific files overriding the default ones.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Properties with Spring Boot (https://www.baeldung.com/properties-with-spring)

5.1. application.properties â€“ the Default Property File
Boot applies itâ€™s typical convention over configuration approach to property files. This means that we can simply put an â€œapplication.propertiesâ€� file in our â€œsrc/main/resourcesâ€� directory, and it will be auto-detected. We can then inject any loaded properties from it as normal.

So, by using this default file, we donâ€™t have to explicitly register a PropertySource, or even provide a path to a property file.

We can also configure a different file at runtime if we need to, using an environment property:
java -jar app.jar --spring.config.location=classpath:/another-location.properties


5.2. Environment Specific Properties File
If we need to target different environments, thereâ€™s a build-in mechanism for that in Boot.

We can simply define an â€œapplication-environment.propertiesâ€� file in the â€œsrc/main/resourcesâ€� directory â€“ and then set a Spring profile with the same environment name.

For example, if we define a â€œstagingâ€� environment, that means weâ€™ll have to define a staging profile and then application-staging.properties.

This env file will be loaded and will take precedence over the default property file. Note that the default file will still be loaded, itâ€™s just that when there is a property collision the environment specific property file takes precedence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties

23.5 Custom log configuration
The various logging systems can be activated by including the appropriate libraries on the classpath, and further customized by providing a suitable configuration file in the root of the classpath, or in a location specified by the Spring Environment property logging.config.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties

24.2.4 JSP limitations
When running a Spring Boot application that uses an embedded servlet container (and is packaged as an executable archive), there are some limitations in the JSP support.

With Tomcat it should work if you use war packaging, i.e. an executable war will work, and will also be deployable to a standard container (not limited to, but including Tomcat). An executable jar will not work because of a hard coded file pattern in Tomcat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties

59.9 Use Jetty instead of Tomcat
The Spring Boot starters (spring-boot-starter-web in particular) use Tomcat as an embedded container by default. You need to exclude those dependencies and include the Jetty one instead. Spring Boot provides Tomcat and Jetty dependencies bundled together as separate starters to help make this process as easy as possible.

Example in Maven:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties


59.11 Use Tomcat 8
Tomcat 8 works with Spring Boot, but the default is to use Tomcat 7 (so we can support Java 1.6 out of the box). You should only need to change the classpath to use Tomcat 8 for it to work. For example, using the starter poms in Maven:

<properties>
    <tomcat.version>8.0.8</tomcat.version>
</properties>
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
change the classpath to use Tomcat 8 for it to work.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application-properties


59.12 Use Jetty 9
Jetty 9 works with Spring Boot, but the default is to use Jetty 8 (so we can support Java 1.6 out of the box). You should only need to change the classpath to use Jetty 9 for it to work.

If you are using the starter poms and parent you can just add the Jetty starter and change the version properties, e.g. for a simple webapp or service:

<properties>
    <java.version>1.7</java.version>
    <jetty.version>9.1.0.v20131115</jetty.version>
    <servlet-api.version>3.1.0</servlet-api.version>
</properties>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>

We can override the default behaviour of spring boot by using the application.properties file. Like we can provide

server.port=8081

to change the default port of the tomcat.

Spring Boot Quick Start 25 - Using application properties

SEE: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html for list of all configurable properties.

Note: the file name has to be application.properties, otherwise it wont work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can create a deafult project structure, including pom.xml, using spring intializr tool (https://start.spring.io/)

The project "myspringbootdata" (committed in git) has been created using this tool.

SEE: Spring Boot Quick Start 22 - Using Spring Initializr

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we add the following dependency in pom.xml:

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.derby</groupId>
			<artifactId>derby</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
		</dependency>
		
Maven will download the necessary apache derby jars and add them to classpath. When we start the application using spring boot, the embedded database is also started. We do not need to provide any dataSource or connection strings in this case, since spring boot, on seeing the apache derby in the classpath, assumes that this is the database to which we need to connect.

SEE: Spring Boot Quick Start 29 - Making Crud Operations with Repository (Also see CrudRepository of Spring Data in this tutorial)

Go through the demo project "myspringbootdata" once. The project somehow does not work with apache derby, but works with h2 database.

29.1.2 Connection to a Production Database:

Production database connections can also be auto-configured by using a pooling DataSource. Spring Boot uses the following algorithm for choosing a specific implementation:

1. We prefer HikariCP for its performance and concurrency. If HikariCP is available, we always choose it.
2. Otherwise, if the Tomcat pooling DataSource is available, we use it.
3. If neither HikariCP nor the Tomcat pooling datasource are available and if Commons DBCP2 is available, we use it.

If you use the spring-boot-starter-jdbc or spring-boot-starter-data-jpa â€œstartersâ€�, you automatically get a dependency to HikariCP.


You can bypass that algorithm completely and specify the connection pool to use by setting the spring.datasource.type property.

DataSource configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in spring.datasource.*. For example, you might declare the following section in application.properties:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
spring.datasource.username=dbuser
spring.datasource.password=dbpass
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

You should at least specify the URL by setting the spring.datasource.url property. Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to auto-configure an embedded database.

You often do not need to specify the driver-class-name, since Spring Boot can deduce it for most databases from the url.

29.2 Using JdbcTemplate
Springâ€™s JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate classes are auto-configured, and you can @Autowire them directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

	private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

	@Autowired
	public MyBean(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
		this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
	}

	// ...

}

29.3 JPA and Spring Data
The Java Persistence API is a standard technology that lets you map objects to relational databases. The spring-boot-starter-data-jpa POM provides a quick way to get started. It provides the following key dependencies:

Hibernate: One of the most popular JPA implementations.
Spring Data JPA: Makes it easy to implement JPA-based repositories.
Spring ORMs: Core ORM support from the Spring Framework.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.journaldev.com/17034/spring-data-jpa
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories

By default, Spring Boot will enable JPA repository support and look in the package (and its subpackages) where @SpringBootApplication is located. If your configuration has JPA repository interface definitions located in a package not visible, you can point out alternate packages using @EnableJpaRepositories and its type-safe basePackageClasses=MyRepository.class parameter.
