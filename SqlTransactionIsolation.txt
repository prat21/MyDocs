REPEATABLE READ ISOLATION:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html#XACT-REPEATABLE-READ
Note: Because a repeatable read transaction cannot modify or lock rows changed by other transactions after the repeatable read transaction began.

"Isolation level and concurrency are inversely related. A lower isolation level enables greater concurrency, but with greater risk of data inconsistencies. A higher isolation level provides a higher degree of data consistency, but at the expense of concurrency."
