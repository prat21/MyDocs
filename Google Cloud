(Serverless VPC Access enables you to connect from a serverless environment on Google Cloud (Cloud Run (fully managed), Cloud Functions,
or the App Engine standard environment) directly to your VPC network.
This connection makes it possible for your serverless environment to access Compute Engine VM instances, Memorystore instances,
and any other resources with an internal IP address.)

Firewall:
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls
https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc#app-engine-comm (Communications and access for App Engine)
Since app Engine standard environment instances do not run inside VPC network, VPC firewall rules do not apply to them.

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/an-overview-of-app-engine
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/configuration-files
You must deploy the initial version of your app to the default service before you can create and deploy additional services to your app.
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/building-app
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/config/appref
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/reference/dispatch-yaml
An app engine app can have only one dispatch.yaml file.
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/labeling-resources
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/how-requests-are-routed
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/application-security#ingress_controls
 If you use Cloud Load Balancing with your App Engine app, we recommend that you use ingress controls to ensure that your app receives only internal
 and Cloud Load Balancing traffic.
 Otherwise, users can use your app's appspot URL to bypass the load balancer.
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/access-control#auth-cloud-implicit-java
By default, the app's environment contains credentials from the default App Engine service account.
This service account is created by Google when you create an App Engine app and is given full permissions to manage and use all Cloud services in a GCP project.
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/service-account
By default, the App Engine default service account has the Editor role in the project.
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/audit-logging#audit_log_format
App Engine doesn't write Data Access audit logs or System Event audit logs.
Admin Activity audit logs and System Event audit logs are free.
Data Access audit logs and Policy Denied audit logs are chargeable.
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/testing-and-deploying-your-app#other_deployment_options

Datastore mode automatically creates single-property indexes for use with simple types of queries.
For complex queries that include multiple properties, you'll need to configure composite indexes in your app's index.yaml file.

Cloud SQL:

https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/clone-instance
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/monitor-instance
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/delete-instance
You cannot delete an instance that has any replicas. You must delete all replicas first.
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-overview
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ip
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/authorize-networks
Even if your instance has only a public IP address, you can connect to it securely by using the Cloud SQL Auth proxy.
All traffic between the Cloud SQL Auth proxy and your Cloud SQL instance is encrypted.
If you don't use the proxy, and you are connecting your client from your own public IP address,
you need to add your client's public address as an authorized network.
Your client application's IP address or address range must be configured as authorized networks for the following conditions:
1. Your client application is connecting directly to a Cloud SQL instance on its public IP address.
2. Your client application is connecting directly to a Cloud SQL instance on its private IP address, and your client's IP address is a non-RFC 1918 address

https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/replication/create-replica
https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/replication/cross-region-replicas
There are two common scenarios for promoting cross-region replicas:
1. Regional migration: Perform a planned migration of a database to a different region.
2. Disaster recovery: Fail over a database to another region in the event that the primary's region becomes unavailable.
Note: Promoting a replica is done manually and intentionally.
It is not the same as high availability,
where a standby instance (which is not a replica) automatically becomes the primary in case of a failure or zonal outage.
