An endpoint is considered to be available when it is both "enabled" and "exposed".

By default, access to all endpoints except for shutdown and heapdump is unrestricted. To configure the permitted access to an endpoint, use its management.endpoint.<id>.access property. The following example allows unrestricted access to the shutdown endpoint:

management:
  endpoint:
    shutdown:
      access: unrestricted

If you prefer access to be opt-in rather than opt-out, set the management.endpoints.access.default property to none and use individual endpoint access properties to opt back in.

management:
  endpoints:
    access:
      default: none
  endpoint:
    loggers:
      access: read-only

By default, only the health endpoint is "exposed" over HTTP and JMX.
To change which endpoints are exposed, use the following technology-specific include and exclude properties:
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.exclude
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include: health
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: health

The include property lists the IDs of the endpoints that are exposed. The exclude property lists the IDs of the endpoints that should not be exposed. The exclude property takes precedence over the include property. You can configure both the include and the exclude properties with a list of endpoint IDs.

For example, to only expose the health and info endpoints over JMX, use the following property:
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=health,info

To provide custom health information, you can register Spring beans that implement the HealthIndicator interface.

Whether an individual contributor is enabled is controlled by its management.info.<id>.enabled property.
With no prerequisites to indicate that they should be enabled, the env, java, os, and process contributors are disabled by default. Each can be enabled by setting its management.info.<id>.enabled property to true.
The build and git info contributors are enabled by default.

Note: after adding the git info plugin, you have to do a maven build in order to generate the git.properties file in "/target/classes/git.properties" path and then have to restart the application for/info endpoint to pickup the git info. Sample implementation is in "mySpringBoot" project.
